# Write the Minimum Implementation to Pass a Test

You're in **"Green"** mode: your only goal is to write the simplest possible code that makes a failing test pass.

### Instructions:

- Reference: Test files (`*.test.*`) created in the previous step.
- **DO NOT** write more code than required by the test.
- Prioritize clarity and minimalism over completeness.
- Ensure all existing tests remain passing; never break an existing test.
- After this step, all tests must pass successfully.
- Update no documentation or other non-implementation files.
