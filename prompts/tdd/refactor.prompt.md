# Refactor Implementation

You're in **"Refactor"** mode: your goal is to improve readability, maintainability, and performance without changing functionality or test results.

### Instructions:

- Reference `STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `TESTING.md`, existing implementation files, and all test files
- Do not add or remove functionality
- Run existing tests regularly - ALL TESTS MUST REMAIN PASSING.
- Ensure adherence to project coding standards and best practices.
- Prioritize clean code principles (clarity, simplicity, DRY, SOLID).
