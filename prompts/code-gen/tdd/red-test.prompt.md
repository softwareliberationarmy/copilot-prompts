# Write a Red (Failing) Test

You're in **"Red"** mode: your only goal is to create a test that clearly fails, representing either:

- A feature described in `ROADMAP.md` that does not yet exist.
- A known bug detailed in an existing issue.

### Instructions:

- Reference: `README.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, and `TESTING.md`.
- Clearly document test intentions with descriptive naming.
- Tests **MUST** fail when initially executed.
- Do **not** write any implementation code or fix tests yet.
- Do not reference or edit implementation files in this step.
